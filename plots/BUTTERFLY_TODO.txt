Currently, the plot shows all data as expected. However, since only 4 different types of accentuation are present in the data to begin
with, then only 4 colors appear in the legend.

1. Make accentual features to appear dynamically using js
2. Check if colors are fixed this time (only checked on couple of plots)
3. Dividing line should appear at 0, not 1
